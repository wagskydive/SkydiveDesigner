# **Design Guide for SkyDive Planner**

This document outlines the visual design principles, UI components, and user flow for the **SkyDive Planner** app. The goal is to create a seamless, user-friendly experience that allows users to design skydives, visualize formations, and connect with the skydiving community. The design should be clean, intuitive, and accessible, with a focus on ease of use for both fun jumpers and competitive skydivers.

## **1. Design Principles**

The overall design will follow these guiding principles:

### **1.1 Minimalism**

### **3.3 Icons and Images**
- **Icons**: Use simple, flat icons to ensure clarity and usability.
  - Use libraries like FontAwesome or Material Icons for consistent and easily recognizable icons.
- **Images**: 
  - App icon should be minimal and incorporate skydiving elements.
  - Visuals in the app (e.g., 3D models of skydivers) should be high-quality but optimized for mobile and web performance.

### **3.4 Buttons & Input Fields**
- **Buttons**: 
  - Primary buttons will have a Sky Blue background with white text.
  - Secondary buttons will be outlined with a thin border and Sky Blue text.

## **4. Interaction Design**

### **4.1 User Flow**
- **Onboarding**: The user starts at the Welcome Screen, where they can either sign in or sign up. Once logged in, they will land on the Dashboard, where they can create or browse jump designs.

- **Creating a Jump**: Users can easily design a new jump by selecting formations from a predefined list or creating a custom formation. They can visualize the jump in 3D, and once they are satisfied, they can save or share it.

- **Sharing Jumps**: Users can share their jump designs with other users, post comments, and interact with other skydivers. 

- **Notifications**: Users will receive notifications about new comments or shared jumps related to their designs. The notification icon will appear on the top-right corner of the app.

### **4.2 Animations & Transitions**
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth page transitions, with a sliding animation when navigating between screens.
- **Button Feedback**: Buttons will have a subtle animation when pressed to provide tactile feedback.
- **Jump Visualization**: When designing a jump, the 3D skydiving formations should animate smoothly as the user makes adjustments.

## **5. Wireframes**

We recommend starting with wireframes for key screens before proceeding to the full visual design. Here are some suggestions for the wireframes:

1. **Welcome Screen**:
   - App logo centered.
   - Two large buttons below for **Sign In** and **Sign Up**.

2. **Login Screen**:
   - Text fields stacked vertically for email and password.
   - Sign In button at the bottom, with links for **Forgot Password** and **Sign Up**.

3. **Dashboard Screen**:
   - Navigation bar at the top with the app logo and profile icon.
   - Search bar prominently displayed.
   - List of jump designs below, displayed as cards or thumbnails.

4. **Jump Design Screen**:
   - Left panel for dropdown menus or formation selection.
   - Right panel displaying the 3D visualization of the jump.
   - Bottom panel with **Save** and **Share** buttons.

## **6. Final Notes**

- **Consistency in Design**: It’s crucial to maintain design consistency throughout the app to ensure users have a seamless experience.
- **Iterative Feedback**: Regular user testing and feedback will be incorporated into the design process to ensure the app meets user needs and is easy to use.

### **Next Steps**

Once we have completed the wireframes, we can move forward with the development phase. These designs will be continuously iterated upon based on feedback, ensuring the app meets user expectations and provides a visually appealing experience.
