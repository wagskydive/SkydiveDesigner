# SkyDive Planner Prototype

This repository contains a simple prototype for the **SkyDive Planner** app. It implements a very basic version of the design documented in `docs/design guide.md`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository using `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd SkydiveDesigner`
3. No additional dependencies are required. If you prefer, you can serve the files using a simple HTTP server, e.g., `python -m http.server`.


## Running

Open `src/index.html` in a web browser to see the prototype. It includes the welcome screen, a login form, and a placeholder dashboard. If you want to skip the login step, use the **Start Demo** button on the welcome screen.

The prototype is static and uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
